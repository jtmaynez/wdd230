          Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve
          him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand
          blameless before God at the last day. Therefore, if ye have desires to
          serve God ye are called to the work;

        <p>
          And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father,
          he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue,
          without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many
          words, for it was given unto them what they should pray, and they were
          filled with desire.
